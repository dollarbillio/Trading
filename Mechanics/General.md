* Never rationalize a loss
* After a ```big spike up```, look for ```consolidation, tight range, small candle, less wick```
* If market ```gap up```, wait for confirmation. If stock fails to open higher than gap -> ```exit```
* If market close ```@Low``` -> hard to expect good rally tmr
* Stock rise because of news, but look for ```price action``` first, then ```news later```
* Buy At ```Market Close```, Sell at ```Market Open```
* If stock moves sharply over the prvs few day --> a greater deal of room for price to fall

### Technicals: 
* ```52 weeks/26 weeks/13 weeks/7 weeks``` breakout
* Create ```Volume Scan``` and ```Volume %```
* Shares price decrease after stock issues/Share buybacks = good issue
* Dollar Volatility
---
### VSA:
* There are ```Weak``` and ```Strong``` holders
* Before Bull Market, ```Weak``` sell, ```Strong``` buy | Before Bear Market, ```Strong``` sell and ```Weak``` buy. If stocks act at the same time, we have the whole market operate in a synthetic manner
* ```High volume```: present of ```Sellers``` -> In the downtrend: Sign of Strength | In the Uptrend: Sign of Weakness
* ```Sellers``` owns the stocks, ```Buyers``` may/may not want to own the stock
