* Never rationalize a loss
* After a ```big spike up```, look for ```consolidation, tight range, small candle, less wick```
* If market ```gap up```, wait for confirmation. If stock fails to open higher than gap -> ```exit```
* If market close ```@Low``` -> hard to expect good rally tmr
* Stock rise because of news, but look for ```price action``` first, then ```news later```
* Buy At ```Market Close```, Sell at ```Market Open```
* If stock moves sharply over the prvs few day --> a greater deal of room for price to fall
