Game of Thirteen
A famous French mathematician Pierre Raymond De Montmart, who was known for his work in combinatorics, proposed a simple game called as Game of Thirteen. You have a deck of 13 cards, each numbered from 1 through 13. Shuffle this deck and draw cards one by one. A coincidence is when the number on the card matches the order in which the card is drawn. For instance, if the 5th card you draw happens to be a 5, it's a coincidence. You win the game if you get through all the cards without any coincidences. Let's calculate the probability of winning at this game using simulation.

```py
# Pre-set constant variables
deck, sims, coincidences = np.arange(1, 14), 10000, 0

for _ in range(sims):
    # Draw all the cards without replacement to simulate one game
    draw = np.random.choice(deck, size=13, replace=False) 
    # Check if there are any coincidences
    coincidence = (draw == list(np.arange(1, 14))).any()
    if coincidence == True:
        coincidences += 1

# Calculate probability of winning
prob_of_winning = 1-coincidences/sims
print("Probability of winning = {}".format(prob_of_winning))
```

We have an urn that contains 7 white and 6 black balls. Four balls are drawn at random. 
We'd like to know the probability that the first and third balls are white, 
while the second and the fourth balls are black.
```py
# Initialize success, sims and urn
success, sims = 0, 5000
urn = ['w']*7 + ['b']*6

for _ in range(sims):
    # Draw 4 balls without replacement
    draw = np.random.choice(urn, replace=False, size=4)
    # Count the number of successes
    if (draw[0] == 'w') & (draw[1] == 'b') & (draw[2] == 'w') & (draw[3] == 'b'):
        success +=1

print("Probability of success = {}".format(success/sims))
```
