* Spend enough time in Demo Account
* Regardless of the reason, very few people who wanted to trade actually become successful. Whether they took other jobs, didn’t feel they got adequate training, or just didn’t make enough money isn’t really the point. They came to trade, but ultimately left with nothing in their pockets while people sitting next to them continued to make money. To me that is the real statistic. Whether you’re lured away, your spouse convinces you not to do it, success doesn’t happen as quickly as you want it, you hit a string of bad luck…the excuse doesn’t matter 
* make no more then 2 trades a day, and never have more then 4 trades running at a time (preferably no more then 2 running at a time so you are able to properly monitor and manage the trades) then you will be fine.
* 'The test is to recognize the mistake, admit it and correct it. To have tried to do something and failed is vastly better than to have tried to do nothing and succeeded.

* If an investor is trading 0.01 per $1000.00 USD, this would be considered a safe investment level.
If you have a ticket in profit, then simply set the SL to breakeven, or just above breakeven for a small profit, then let
the ticket run, and stack another 0.01 ticket into your basket. 
Just keep doing that until the market tells you when to get out of the trade.
Be sure to keep moving your SL levels as your tickets increase in profits.
When your SL hits and closes out your tickets, you will have collected profits on all your tickets

* There are no ultimate "hidden secrets" to profitable trading in Forex.

Just pick the correct direction of movement, and place the trade.

A currency pair can only do one of three things.

1) Move up
2) Nothing. Not moving.
3) Move down

I determine which way the market is moving, verify the movement is true, and then place my trade with a REASONABLE profit target.

My stop loss is generally no greater than 30 pips.

If it moves up and the general trend is up, I buy..
If it does not move, I don't do anything.
If it moves down and the general trend is down, I sell

If a trade is going bad, I don't hold on to it, I kill the trade, and just wait for the next setup for entry. 

If it's just sitting still without any real indication of what the market movement is, then don't do anything.

Pay attention to your technical analysis so you can see the strength and speed of market moves, but you must also pay attention to your fundamental analysis as well, as that will tell you the reasons why of the markets are moving.

Emotions have no place in trading. It's just data on the screen. Nothing more.

If you enter with a small ticket size, you can always stack additional tickets into your trade basket and cover them with your winning ticket profits, etc etc etc.
When you have a winning trade, let it run it's course, move your SL level to just above entry price for break even, then just wait patiently for the trade to hit the TP target.

Automate those tasks which are easily automated.

And for those tasks which you determine cannot be fully automated for your strategy, then you must practice and master those items until you feel comfortable with your skill set for trading on a live account.

To start with, he told me that there are vast differences between demo trading and live trading. The first and most obvious being the 'human emotion' aspect of it. In demo trading you don't feel the fear, greed, confusion, anger, etc. Simply because it is not real money. Mistakes on a demo account does not affect you.

you should carefully develop a Money Management (managing winning trades) and Risk Management (managing losses) strategy/rules. This is the ONLY way to ensure that you manage your account properly and can get up tomorrow to trade again. Things like Risk/Reward (Stop-loss/Take Profit), Maximum Risk (calculation of stop-loss distance and lot size) per trade/ and per account. So say for example your will not risk losing more than 1% per trade and 5% in total for all trades. I think you should get the idea of what I am talking about. These are extremely important rules that MUST be in place and be obeyed if you don't want to blow your account in a week or month like I did.

In closing, my best advice, based on personal experience, is not create expectations in this game. Do your homework, get your carefully developed Trading Plan, Risk/Money Management and Trading Strategy in place, and then treat it like you would proper business or high profile job.


I would say for the first 6 months just watch videos, read, look at stuff, take trades with the smallest amounts possible if you want to.
Spend time backtesting ideas. 6 months is rather short really. Even the shortest formations (haircutter etc) take longer right?
Also depends if you are full time or not. I think 2 years is required for people to have a diploma to bake bread and make cakes.
People think trading is easier than baing bread? C'mon.
Just spend a couple thousands of hours accumulating info and trying to understand 'why did the market move in that direction rather than that one' and 'why did this strategy stop working' etc.
Honestly it's going to take years imo. If you full time 16 hours a day, maybe it'll only take 1 year lol idk.

Then eventually when you have some solid background & understanding, I think you would find it useful to stick to these rules:

1- Preserve capital.
2- Preserve mental capital.
3- Build a bias.
4- Have systems to enter and (more importantly?) exit.
5- Find ideas to enter.

Etc, those are the main 5 ones. We are all different but I think having this way of seeing things help. Being organised and having a solid set routine/set of rules is just too awesome not to do.

You need experience to know what to do in different scenarios.
I am pretty sure there is no simple no brainer strategy you can just apply... Makes no sense to think there is.

Good Risk to reward means take only those trades which has very high probability of success with take profit and stoploss ratio of more than 2 or even more.

But if someone will take just every trade and hope the market will give at least 2 times profit pips compared to his stop loss, then it is a wrong approach.

All new traders must reduce the number trades they take every day or every week to half and then, naturally their trading profits will increase since they will take only high probability trades.

If emotions create problem for new traders, then set and forget type style of trading is best with pending orders to get triggered automatically with fixed stoploss and takeprofit.

If new traders will enter market orders, it very easy to make wrong decisions based on emotions or fear of missing out trades etc.

What is Grid and Martingale System? With a large enough account balance, and the smallest possible trade units or lot sizes, martingale and grid systems can be extremely profitable.

However martingale and grid systems are not the same thing. Grid systems do not always use Martingale.

Martingale is generally used to calculate the size increment level of the next trade that you are going to open.

Martingale doesn't have a specific entry and exit point. 

Your entry and exit points would be determined by your trading strategy.
Martingale determines the size of the trade.
